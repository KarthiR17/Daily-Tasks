        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque euismod turpis felis, a vulputate erat
            egestas a. Suspendisse potenti. Phasellus pharetra lacus sapien, a viverra ligula pellentesque sit amet.
            Vivamus dapibus massa nec dolor auctor interdum. Integer interdum consequat sem at pharetra. Proin
            scelerisque eros ut ligula cursus, sed tincidunt libero dignissim. Integer malesuada libero et velit
            accumsan, at tristique lorem interdum. Nullam ultricies neque at malesuada varius.</p>
        <P>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
            Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into
            paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and
            thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</P>
        <p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief
            examples or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process;
            narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or
            describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share
            certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.More content...</p>
        <p>A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence
            called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an
            essay’s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and
            it advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers
            generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the
            paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. In
            some cases, however, it’s more effective to place another sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a
            sentence linking the current paragraph to the previous one, or one providing background information.More
            content...</p>
        <p>Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few situations when a paragraph might not
            need a topic sentence. For example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates
            a series of events, if a paragraph continues developing an idea that you introduced (with a topic sentence)
            in the previous paragraph, or if all the sentences and details in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps
            indirectly—to a main point. The vast majority of your paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence.More
            content...</p>
        <p>In a coherent paragraph, each sentence relates clearly to the topic sentence or controlling idea, but there
            is more to coherence than this. If a paragraph is coherent, each sentence flows smoothly into the next
            without obvious shifts or jumps. A coherent paragraph also highlights the ties between old information and
            new information to make the structure of ideas or arguments clear to the reader.More content...</p>
        <p>Along with the smooth flow of sentences, a paragraph’s coherence may also be related to its length. If you
            have written a very long paragraph, one that fills a double-spaced typed page, for example, you should check
            it carefully to see if it should start a new paragraph where the original paragraph wanders from its
            controlling idea. On the other hand, if a paragraph is very short (only one or two sentences, perhaps), you
            may need to develop its controlling idea more thoroughly, or combine it with another paragraph.</p>
